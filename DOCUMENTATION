                                          DFS
                                          ===

    Introduction
    ============
    
    DFS is a simple command line utility for creating and reading DFS disc images as
    used by many BBC emulators. If you don't know anything about these try looking at
    the sites http://8bs.com and http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/bbc/index.php3 for more 
    information.
    
    I created this utility as I wanted something that would be simple to include in
    scripts and make files. If you want something with a nicer user interface there 
    are plenty of other pieces of software available.
    
    Currently DFS only creates *standard* (i.e. not Watford) single-sided DFS images.
    
    INF Files
    =========
    
    BBC DFS (and ADFS) files contain some file attribute such as load and execution 
    addresses which are not contained within the file and which cannot easily be 
    maintained in non BBC filing-systems. For more information on inf files see
    http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/bbc/std-format.php3
    
    Usage
    =====
    
    (this is the message printed by `dfs help`)
    
        Usage: dfs <command> [<options>] <image> [<files to add>]
        
        Command is one of:
        help                   print this message
        info                   catalogue disc
        read                   read file(s)
        add                    add file(s)
        form                   format i.e. create new image
        version                print version information and exit
        
        Info options:
        -w <wildcard>          see read
        
        Read options:
        -w <wildcard>          *info type wildcards (you'll need to put them
                                in single quotes to stop expansion) or filename
        -d <dir>               Dump to specified directory
        -i                     Create .inf files
        
        Form options:
        -40                    Create a 40 track disc
        -80                    Create an 80 track disc (default)
        
        Add options:    For add operation <image> is followed by a list of files
                        to add. The files can either be files or their associated .inf
                        files. i.e. *.inf. If an inf file is specified will, look for
                        a file without the .inf extension and vice versa.
        -l                     Load address - in hex i.e. 000E00 overrides inf file
        -e                     Exec address - ditto -
        -f                     BBC file name - overrides inf file
        -k                     File is locked - overrides inf
        -u                     File is unlocked - overrides inf
                        You must either supply a .inf file with a filename in it or
                        pass the filename parameter
                        Be careful adding names, very little filename checking is done
                        and corrupt discs may be produced. This is so in the hope that
                        it might be of help in creating "copy protected" discs???
                        and its late at night and I just want it to work now...
 
    Examples
    ========

    1. Create a disc image of a set of files in a directory
    -------------------------------------------------------
    
    Suppose a directory ./x contains the files a, a.inf, b, b.inf, c, c.inf....
    To create a dfs image 'x.img' containing these files do:
    
      > dfs form x.img
      > dfs add x.img x/*.inf
      
    The first line creates the disc image, the second line will add each inf file to
    the image. (When you attempt to add a .inf file to an image dfs will actually add
    the file without the .inf extension, using the .inf for the attributes
    
    2. Add a regular file to a disc, specifying load and execute addresses
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Suppose you now wish to add a file readme.txt to the image created above and call
    it "README" and set its load and execute addresses to standard "text file" addresses:
    
       > dfs add -l 0x000000 -e 0xFFFFFF -f README -u x.img readme.txt

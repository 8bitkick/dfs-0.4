Installation on RISC OS
=======================

I would suggest one of the following methods of compilation:

- use gccsdk, follow the instructions in INSTALL excepting that the scripts
  ~/env/ro-make, ~/env/ro-config should be used. Copy dfs,ffe to the library
  directory of your RISC OS machine (try $.!BOOT.Library)

- download the pre-build package and copy the dfs file in it as above

- try and compile with Castle C/C++, this has not been tried

Limitations
===========

1. Wildcards
------------
The RISC OS version does not support wildcards for adding files. (Unless you use bash).

To perform example 1 from the DOCUMENTATION file you will need to do something like:

Set Alias$DFSaddinf If "%1" RIGHT 4 = "/inf" Then dfs add %0 %1

Repeat "DFSaddinf x/img" -files x

2. Filename lengths
-------------------
Generated filename lengths may be too long for some older ADFS like filesystems. 

If there is sufficient interest in providing a work around (any suggestions) then
contact me and I'll have a look

3. Use RISC OS load/exec addresses
----------------------------------
It should be possible to provide some extra switches for use with RISC OS that will
allow the use of the load/exec fields provided by RISC OS. Again please contact me
if you feel this would be useful
